This is Google's proto.vim and a simple ftdetect file.

Source: https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/editors/proto.vim

I'm providing this bundled up as a git repository, for easy use with Pathogen.
I do not plan to keep this file up to date with changes, however, I'll gladly
accept pull requests if Google does change proto.vim and you send it my way.
